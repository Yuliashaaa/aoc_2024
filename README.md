# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024 Solutions
Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository! ðŸŽ…âœ¨
Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge during December that brings together developers from all over the world.
Each day, a new problem is unlocked, with fun stories and tricky puzzles to solve!

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
The solutions are organized by day, with each day having its own folder:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ day_01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt       # Input data for the puzzle
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part_1.py       # Solution for Part 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part_1.md       # Task for Part 1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part_2.py       # Solution for Part 2
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ part_2.md       # Task for Part 2
â”œâ”€â”€ day_02/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...             # Same structure for other days
...
```
